This project contains solutions to the Advent of Code puzzles, which can be found at https://github.com/rramdin/adventofcode.git

The project is organized into these directories:
* docs - the puzzle descriptions for Advent of Code
* input - my input files from the Advent of Code webiste
* src - solutions

TODO: move tests to their own directories
